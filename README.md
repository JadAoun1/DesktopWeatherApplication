### Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Directory
Open a command prompt or terminal, and change to the directory where you cloned the repository.

```bash
cd path/to/cloned/repository
```

For example:

```bash
cd weather-dashboard
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Before running the project, you need to install its dependencies. This typically involves running an npm install command, which reads the `package.json` file in the project directory to install the necessary packages.

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all dependencies listed in your `package.json`, including development dependencies necessary to build and run your project.

### Step 3: Build the Project (if necessary)
Some projects require a build step to compile or prepare the application files before running. If your project uses Tailwind CSS, you may need to build your CSS first:

```bash
npm run build:css
```

This command will process your CSS using PostCSS and Tailwind, compiling it into a usable format in your application.

### Step 4: Launch the Development Server
To view and test your project in a browser, you'll use a development server. If you have `live-server` or a similar package installed, you can start it by running:

```bash
live-server
```

Or, if your project includes a script to start a server, you might run a command like:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npm run dev
```

This depends on the specific scripts defined in your `package.json`. These commands typically start a local server, open your default web browser, and load the project so you can view and interact with it.

### Step 5: Verify the Server is Running
Ensure the server starts correctly and loads the project. You should see output in the terminal indicating that the server is running, usually with a URL where the project is accessible (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

### Step 6: Open the Project in a Web Browser
If the server doesnâ€™t automatically open your web browser, manually open your browser and enter the local URL provided by your development server.

### Step 7: Make Changes and Refresh
With `live-server` and similar tools, any changes you make to the project files (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) will automatically refresh in the browser, so you can see updates in real-time.

### Step 8: Stop the Server
When you're done working, you can stop the server by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window where the server is running.
